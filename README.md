# AI Learning Resources Repository

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of learning materials and code snippets related to various topics in Artificial Intelligence, **curated primarily for my students**. Iâ€™m sharing it publicly in case others find it useful for study or exploration.

## Repository Structure

The content is organized into the following main folders, each focused on a major AI topic:

- **AI Planning**  
- **Computer Vision**  
- **Deep Learning**  
- **Distributed AI**  
- **Intelligent Games**  
- **Machine Learning**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- **Python Basics**

Each folder contains relevant files and scripts. At this moment, the materials are mostly raw and lightly documented but can serve as a solid starting point.
